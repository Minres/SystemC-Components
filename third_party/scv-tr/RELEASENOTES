1) What's new in this release?
==============================

This is an update of the SCV 1.0p2 release of the SystemC verification library.
The primary purpose of this update is to support the Accellera Systems
Initiative (Accellera) SystemC versions 2.3.1 and 2.3.0 (compliant with
IEEE Std 1666-2011 (tm)) as well as the old Accellera SystemC version 2.2.0
(compliant with IEEE Std 1666-2005 (tm)).

Support for recent compilers is also included. This includes an experimental
support for Microsoft Visual C++ 64-bit builds (with SystemC 2.3.1).


2) Bug fixes and enhancements
=============================

o The SCV introspection extensions classes now always provide an
  ostream output operator.

o Memory leaks and potential use of garbage values were found in SCV
  and CUDD through the Clang static analyzer and fixed. Implementation
  assumptions that may lead to undefined behavior have rendered
  explicit by inserting assertions.

o Code, which triggered compiler warnings on recent C++ compilers, has
  been fixed.

o The SCV headers include now less unused external headers.

o The code base has been cleaned up by removing code specific to very
  old (non-standard-conforming) C++ compilers and associated
  preprocessor macros.

o The configure script has been cleaned up by removing many tests for
  unused libraries.

o For backward compatibility reasons, the scv.h still contains a
  'using namespace std' statement, which is bad coding practice, as it
  exposes all symbols from all included C++ standard libraries so that
  they can potentially conflict with user code. However, it is now
  possible to avoid namespace pollution, when including scv.h, by
  defining the symbol SCV_DISABLE_USING_NAMESPACES. Then, the scv.h
  header does not anymore import as a side effect all symbols from the
  std namespace into the global namespace. Only those symbols from std
  remain, which are already imported by systemc.h. In future versions,
  we expect to deliver a <scv> header that will not pollute namespaces
  by default and that will be the recommended header for using the
  SCV library.


3) Other changes
================

o Support for SystemC versions pre-dating OSCI SystemC 2.2 and thus the
  IEEE Std 1666-2005 has been removed.

o The class template _scv_CstructMethods<T> defined in
  src/scv/_scv_data_structure.h has been excluded from compilation, as
  its implementation is questionable and it is neither used in the SCV
  nor the accompanying examples.

o The original implementation of scv_report and all associated
  internal classes have been removed. Support for the deprecated
  scv_report and SCV_REPORT_* macros remains through aliases to the
  corresponding SystemC sc_report functions and macros.

o Support for the non-C++-standard hash<T> container (provided by some
  old implementations of the STL in the header <hash_map.h>) has been
  removed.

o Support for using the long-deprecated and non-C++-standard header
  <iostream.h> for I/O operation has been removed.


4) Known limitations
====================

o There are still differences between the SCV installation process and
  the one for the SystemC core library. See the file INSTALL for
  details.

o Introspection is not supported for fixed point data types
  (scv_fixed<>, etc). This means that randomization can not be
  done for these types.

o Constrained randomization cannot be done with floating point types.
  However, simple constraints can be done with floating point types,
  so it is possible to get similar effects by overloading the next()
  method in a constraint which includes floating point types.

  For example:
    struct constraint : public scv_constraint_base {
      scv_smart_ptr<double> d;
      scv_smart_ptr<int> i;
      SCV_CONSTRAINT_CTOR(constraint) {
        SCV_CONSTRAINT( d() < 0.01 && i() < 10 );
      }
    };

  must be written as:
    struct constraint : public scv_constraint_base {
      scv_smart_ptr<double> d;
      scv_smart_ptr<int> i;
      SCV_CONSTRAINT_CTOR(constraint) {
        d->keep_only(-FLT_MAX/2, 0.01);
        SCV_CONSTRAINT( i() < 10 );
      }
    };

o Complex constraints which use arithmethic operators may take
  a long time to solve. Constraints involving multiplication operations
  should be limited to 8 bit by 8 bit numbers. Larger than this will
  cause simulations to effectively hang. For example, the following
  constraint will never finish due to the two 32 bit by 32 bit
  multiplications:

    struct constraint : public scv_constraint_base {
      scv_smart_ptr<int> a, b, c;
      SCV_CONSTRAINT_CTOR(constraint) {
        SCV_CONSTRAINT( (a() * b()) < (b() * c()) );
      }
    };

o We do not support smart pointers to arrays. You can work around
  this limitation by wrapping a struct around the array.

o We do not implement scv_connect(). This function creates a
  connection between a SystemC and an HDL signal. It is intended
  that vendor implementations of SystemC will include an scv_connect()
  that supports connections with specific HDL simulators.

o We have not run our full regression suite using VC++, and are not
  prepared to claim full support under Windows.

o Certain compiler versions (e.g., gcc 4.1.2 of RHEL 5) issue warnings
  like "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing
  rules" when compiling the CUDD 2.3.0 library, which is part of the
  SCV implementation. These warnings are triggered by the calls to the
  CUDD function st_lookup(). They seem to be a false positive and can
  be silenced by adding -Wno-strict-aliasing to the CFLAGS environment
  variable. With -fno-strict-aliasing, optimizations profiting from
  the strict-aliasing rules are turned off that risk to break code.


5) Beta features
================

The SCV library consists of the following set of features:

o Simple constrainted randomization
o Complex constrained randomization (multi-variable constraints)
o Random distributions and distribution ranges
o Composite and enumerated datatype introspection
o Transaction recording
o Verification datastructure
o Messaging


6) Deprecated features
======================

The SCV_REPORT_INFO, SCV_REPORT_WARNING, SCV_REPORT_ERROR and SCV_REPORT_FATAL
macros are now typedefs for the corresponding SC_REPORT_* macros. New
applications should use SC_REPORT_* (as specified in the IEEE 1666(tm) standard)
rather than SCV_REPORT_*.
